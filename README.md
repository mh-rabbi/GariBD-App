# 🚗GariBD — Second-Hand Vehicle Buy/Sell Platform

GariBD is a second-hand car and bike listing platform, built as a **Software Engineering course project** by me and my friend Sakib. Our goal was to design a functional Android application where users can post, browse, and manage used vehicle listings in an intuitive and efficient way.

## 🛠 Project Background

The project was initially designed to integrate a custom REST API using **Volley** for backend communications (such as car/bike post submissions and retrieval). JSON array parsing with Volley was implemented. However, due to delays and incompatibility with the external API provider, we transitioned the backend to **Firebase**, allowing us to meet our final course project deadline.

> 📌 Although I started this repository with the original API-based version, we completed the full implementation and final commits totally one by one on my teammate's repository.

## 👨‍💻 My Contributions

As part of this collaborative project, I actively worked on several key modules and UI features, including:

- 🚗 **Car Listings Page** — Implemented the interface and backend logic to display available second-hand cars dynamically.
- 🔍 **Car Filtering System** — Developed a custom filter dialog allowing users to search cars based on brand, price, and other attributes.
- 📧 **Support Activity** — Created an in-app support page enabling users to send emails for assistance directly from the app.
- 👤 **Profile Management** — Built the user profile module where users can view and update their personal details.
- 📄 **Detail View Page** — Designed the detailed listing view that opens when a car or bike post is tapped, showing complete post information.
- 🧭 **Navigation Drawer & Bottom Navigation** — Structured the navigation architecture using a side drawer and bottom navigation bar for intuitive access across the app.

## 🧠 Future Plan

I plan to **rebuild this application using Flutter** for cross-platform deployment (iOS + Android). However, to bring this vision to life, I’ll need:

- A reliable and flexible **RESTful API** that meets the original requirements
- Backend contributors or API providers

🤝 **Open to collaboration!** If you’re a backend developer or API enthusiast and would like to help, feel free to reach out.
